# Changelog

All notable Rackpad changes should be recorded here.

Rackpad uses semantic versioning and Git tags in the form `vX.Y.Z`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Fastify + SQLite backend with routes for racks, devices, ports, cables, VLANs, IPAM, and audit history.
- API-backed frontend store and bootstrapping flow for loading live data.
- Real device lifecycle actions: create, edit, delete, management IP sync, and IP release.
- Real port and cable management screens, including cable create, edit, inspect, and delete flows.
- Docker deployment, systemd service file, Linux install guide, and Node 22 runtime pinning.

### Changed

- Installation instructions now pull versioned source directly from GitHub instead of assuming a copied local folder.
- Docker defaults now point at the `Kobii-git/Rackpad` repository and the `v0.2.0` release tag.
- Release process expectation is now explicit: future shipped changes should include a version bump and changelog entry.

### Notes

- This is the first versioned GitHub-ready release for Docker and Linux testing.
